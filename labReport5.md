**The original post from a student with a screenshot showing a symptom and a description of a guess at the bug/some sense of what the failure-inducing input is**
Hi, I am having an issue with my script. It seems to say that the submission is not a file when it indeed is. I passed in a student file as the argument to my script so that it can be graded.
I am not sure why the script says that it is not a file. Can I please get some help with this? Here is my script and the output that I get from grading the student submission.
